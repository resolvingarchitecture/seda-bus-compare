  <p><strong>Resolving Architecture &mdash; Clarity in Design</strong></p>
  <p>A cross-language comparison of the seven <a href="../">seda-bus</a> implementations.</p>
</div>

`seda-bus` — a small, broker-less, staged message bus — exists in seven
language ports: Java, Rust, Python, TypeScript, C++, C#, and Go, all built
from [one shared design](../DESIGN.md). This repo compares them: the same
benchmark workload, run identically in all seven, plus a table of the
structural differences already documented per-port (worker pool model,
dependencies, envelope source, and more).

- **[`METHODOLOGY.md`](METHODOLOGY.md)** — what's measured, how, and — just
  as important — what it doesn't mean. Read this before the numbers.
- **[`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md)** — the numbers.
- **[`bench/WORKLOAD.md`](bench/WORKLOAD.md)** — the benchmark specification
  every `bench/<lang>` program implements identically.

## Reproducing this

Requires Docker and the sibling repos checked out at the standard monorepo
layout (`setup.sh` verifies this, and can clone them for you):

```sh
./setup.sh                     # verify (or SETUP_CLONE=1 ./setup.sh to clone) sibling repos
./scripts/build_and_run.sh     # build all 8 images (7 languages + Python's
                                # free-threaded variant), run each, write
                                # results/raw/<lang>.jsonl
python3 scripts/aggregate.py   # write results/summary.csv, print the RESULTS.md table
```

Every language builds inside its own Docker container with a pinned base
image — see `bench/<lang>/Dockerfile` — so results don't depend on whatever
happens to already be installed on the machine running this. See
`METHODOLOGY.md` for why that matters here specifically (none of
`ra-common-*`/`seda-bus-*` are published to a package registry).

## Structure

```
bench/
  WORKLOAD.md       the shared benchmark specification
  <lang>/           one program per language, same logic, reading the spec
    Dockerfile      pinned toolchain, builds against the sibling ra-common-*/seda-bus-*
results/
  raw/<lang>.jsonl  one JSON object per trial (see WORKLOAD.md's output contract)
  summary.csv       aggregated by scripts/aggregate.py
scripts/
  build_and_run.sh  builds + runs every bench/<lang> image
  aggregate.py      raw/*.jsonl -> summary.csv + the RESULTS.md table
setup.sh            verifies/clones the sibling repos this depends on
```

## What this found

Building this surfaced a real bug, not just numbers: the first C++ run was
20-30x slower than Rust for identical work, traced to `ra-common-cpp`
reopening `/dev/urandom` on every random-byte call. Fixed upstream
(`ra-common-cpp` commit `8700729`) — see `METHODOLOGY.md` for the full
story. That's the kind of thing a same-shape cross-language benchmark is
for.
